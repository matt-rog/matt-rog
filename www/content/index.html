    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Matthew Rogers and this is my personal website! This site will house
      updates on my projects and anything else I feel is worth sharing.
    </p>

    <h2>> About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I find learning and creating extremely fulfulling. I'm particularly
      interested in working with and designing systems of any sort. I've been
      drawn to fields involving computers, but I also try to spend time in the
      worlds of motorsport, architecture, and (graphic) design.
      <br /><br />

      I'm an undergraduate software engineering student at
      <a href="https://eng.auburn.edu/" target="_blank">Auburn University</a>. I
      enjoy my work in theoretical computer science, system design, and
      cybersecurity. I sometimes formally engage with philosophy and
      mathematics. <br /><br />

      I also help organize
      <a href="https://www.auburnhacks.com/" target="_blank">Auburn Hacks</a>,
      the annual 24-hour hackathon held at Auburn University in the spring. If
      you're in the American Southeast and are interested in technology, be sure
      to register. <br /><br />

      Professionally, I work part time as a security analyst and contract as a
      web developer. I've also had some backend web experience via internships.
      A dream job allows me to continue learning, make a difference, and support
      and spend time with the people I love. I think it's likely I'll find this
      in security research or systems (software) engineering.
      <br /><br />

      Outside of academia and industry, I continue to work on projects that I'm
      especially passionate about. One of my largest is an
      <a href="https://okfn.org/en/" target="_blank">open data</a> platform
      currently applied in the form of
      <a href="https://www.openauburn.org" target="_blank">Open Auburn</a>.

      <br /><br />As mattrog.com progresses I'll talk more about open data and
      my projects, but for now I encourage you to browse my
      <a href="https://www.github.com/matt-rog" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

    <h2>> Where's the rest of this site?</h2>
    <p>
      In this project I aim to engage with systems and socket programming,
      component building, and web compliance in a way that is (appropriately)
      rarely demanded by modern web development. The web is incredibly complex,
      however frameworks/libraries have made it easy to take this complexity for
      granted. Working on a simple, long-term project like this seemed like best
      opportunity to interact with more fundamental web technologies.

      <br /><br />
      So, for some time, this site may look a little archaic. Follow my progress
